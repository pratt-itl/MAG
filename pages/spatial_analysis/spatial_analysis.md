## Spatial Analysis & Simulation // ML & Sensors
---

The primary focus of this research is *spatial prospecting - to collect, analyze, and mine spatial data* to reveal human macro and micro structures hidden deep in our spatial and temporal dimensions. We are developing novel ways to combine machine learning, computer vision, photogrammetry, IoT devices, industrial design, architecture, and urban design, to allow us to gain insights into the relationship between space, design, and human behavior. There are several research areas that are currently undertaken by MAG under this topic., each with its own subset of challenges and goals. 

We have categorized our research areas two domains: Public and Private. Public space analytics prioritizes itself with gathering anonymous spatial data in both urban and indoor environments so we can gain insight into how design can facilitate social interactions. Private space analytics, on the other hand, is predicated on the use of data to help facilitate planning and management.

### Spatial Analytics with Machine Learning

This research proposes a fully automated, autonomous, and anonymous approach to spatial and behavioral tracking using uncalibrated and unordered video footages and Building Information Models. The proposed technology allows us to utilize video recordings from most existing security camera system and extract information on how people interact with objects in space and their tendencies to congregate in certain areas. The spatial and behavioral tracking and analysis uses state of the art machine learning algorithm in object detection and pose estimation to produce a 3-dimensional point cloud dataset which can then be visualized as a heatmap for understanding activity concentrations. 

We also extract data for body gestures and how people interact with objects such as urban furniture, sculptures, lawn, trees, and other types of and  The system targets the archaic practice in urban design and architecture where spatial usage pattern data is collected with a survey by hand and on foot, which leads to highly inaccurate, unintelligibly biased, and practically useless results.

### IoT Senor Network for Environmental and Behavioral Tracking

This research topic encompasses a number of research areas that are currently undertaken by MAG at ITL. The primary focus of this research is spatial prospecting - to collect, analyze, and mine spatial data to reveal macro and micro structures and behaviors that would be otherwise hidden from human senses, and to harness that knowledge for the betterment of our built environments.

### Vision Based Building Occupancy Tracking System

We are developing a computer vision based building occupancy tracking system that can acquire real-time and static 3D information to assess a building's occupancy state. The system relies on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for realtime and Structure From Motion (SFM) for static data acquisition.
