## Spatial Analysis & Simulation // ML & Sensors
---

The primary focus of this research is *spatial prospecting - to collect, analyze, and mine spatial data* to reveal macro and micro structures hidden deep in our spatial and temporal dimensions. We are developing novel ways to combine machine learning, computer vision, photogrammetry, IoT devices, industrial design, architecture, and urban design, to allow us to gain insights into the relationship between space, design, and human behavior. There are several research areas that are currently undertaken by MAG under this topic., each with its own subset of challenges and goals. 

We have categorized our research areas based on a number of anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric factors. They include anything from building performances, built ecologies - building, and environments in the post-anthropocene. On the other hand, human factors under investigations include, 

Our research was initiated by a series of conversations with our potential collaborators and by the internal needs within the institute. It started simply as a way to ask simple question with regard to the nature of space. Is the room too big or too small? Is the layout efficient? Are the furniture enhancing or disrupting people's concentration? As architects, understanding how space affects our behavior is one of the fundamental foundations in our profession. However, the ability to see beyond the temporal dimension is only possessed by very few, such as Jane Jacobs' assertion that eyes on the street make a safe and intimate neighborhood. However, strong observation is only the beginning of the scientific method, and we need much more than doctrines in the age of big data to inform high level decisions that may impact many.... blurb

### Spatial Analytics with Machine Learning

This research topic encompasses a number of research areas that are currently undertaken by MAG at ITL. The primary focus of this research is spatial prospecting - to collect, analyze, and mine spatial data to reveal macro and micro structures and behaviors that would be otherwise hidden from human senses, and to harness that knowledge for the betterment of our built environments.

### Vision Based Building Occupancy Tracking System

We are developing a computer vision based building occupancy tracking system that can acquire real-time and static 3D information to assess a building's occupancy state. The system relies on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for realtime and Structure From Motion (SFM) for static data acquisition.
