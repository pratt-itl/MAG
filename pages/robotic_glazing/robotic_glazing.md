## Sentient Collaborative Robotics // Scanning & Glazing
---

Collaborative robotics over the next few years will without a doubt become a game changer for the entire fabrication and construction industry. Greater mechanization will enable manual labor to be minimized, as a means of achieving greater efficiencies and cost savings. We are in a crucial period of transition for architecture and design. The ITL/MAG is helping to cultivate a healthier discourse on the subject and to ensure their position in the field by concentrating technological efforts towards high-quality design and fabrication rather than just solely on operational productivity.

The research highlights such critical questions as: How can robotics expand on the variety of production and design options by increasing the potential for more significant material differentiation, performance, and complexity of form? What are the possibilities for applying robotics across a large scale of disciplines? What happens when one transfers the hand of the master into new tools and material practices by developing agency through awareness?

Robotics in the creative disciplines has the potential to recast the entire field as a practice: the modern division between intellectual work and manual production, between design and realization, is being rendered obsolete. What is apparent, though, is that it is only through informed speculation, research, and experimentation that architects, designers, and artists will ever have the hope of being significant players at the table when the cost, time and space of making has collapsed.
