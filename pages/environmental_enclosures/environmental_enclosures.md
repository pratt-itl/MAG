> This flat-pack, easy to assemble system allows for deployment within various interior environments, providing an acoustical ‘bubble’ with customizable interior workspace for one or two occupants.

Contemporary work environments are all too often unable to keep up with the constantly shifting demands of its users. Evolving workplace culture, behaviors and desires, as well as the rise in diverse collaborative project management, have placed undue strain on the physical constraints of interior spatial and furniture design. Beholden to arcs of financial and temporal pressures, addressing these evolving needs often manifests in makeshift solutions that underwhelm and underperform, as opposed to the comprehensive renovations that are required. 

Responding to these pressures, at the disjunct between workplace space-planning and dynamic use, the ‘Escape Pod’ provides a refuge, accommodating flexibility at both the spatial and furniture scale. The holistic approach towards the ‘Escape Pod’ tempers both use and performance in addition to pragmatics, providing a sub-space within an existing environment.

The interior configuration, composed of a tabletop, chairs and pin-up surface, is sized appropriately to accommodate one to two individuals. Depending on occupancy or needs of users, the interior is customizable via a calibrated oversized peg-wall system that allows for the adjustments of size and space to the interior environment.

Comfort and temporal solitude is/are provided by the escape pods carefully selected materials, embedded systems, and unique layered construction. Providing not only a durable and aesthetically pleasing interior, but an acoustical shell allowing for privacy and separation from external surroundings. 

Adjustable lighting and constant ventilation, achieved without compromising acoustical performance, allows for tailoring of the interior environment for users desired needs and comfort.

Pragmatically, the escape pod by design is deployable in a multitude of spaces given its flat-pack shipment and ease of assembly. This allows unskilled labor to efficiently deliver, move and configure the pod using the door and standard elevator bay as a design constraint. Simple mechanical connections with limited tools and drop in material layers are designed for ease of construction by a limited number of individuals. 

The resulting ‘escape pods’ can be a stand-alone addition to a work environment, or configured in a handful of organizations from bays to linked connection producing larger spaces. Once assembled, added flexibility with industrial casters truly supports the promise of adaptable microenvironments design.

### Acoustical Material Testing

![](./images/IMG_9034.jpg)

In accounting for acoustical properties of building materials, a single-value Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC), or Sound Transmission Class (STC) value, is used by the industry as a standard metric. Both value systems describe how well a material absorbs sound energy. While NRC focuses on the reflected sound, STC focuses on the transmitted sound, usually in the range of normal speech frequencies between 120 Hz to 4000 Hz [^1]. Therefore, one can say this industry standard is biased towards noises in the human vocal range.  

[^1]: http://www.montana.edu/rmaher/eele417_fl14/Determination_of_STC.pdf

However, while NRC and STC metrics remains as industry standards, the frequency range and testing methodology is slow to adapt to our rapiding changing living and working environment. In an age when homes and offices have mostly favored the open plan layout where sound transmits freely, and with diversifying home and office cultures where activities like desktop prototyping with CNC machines, doggy daycare, and aerobic exercises can happen in the same space, these single value metrics are no longer adequate in assessing our aural environments.  

According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, long term exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss [^2]. This metric to correlate sound pressure levels to hearing loss is, however, much too simplistic because it does not describe how different frequencies of sound affects our health differently. In particular, the noise / stress correlation finds that noise can activate our stress regulating systems - hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathoadrenal system[^3] and immediately triggering physiological response such as fight / flight or defeat reactions. 

In addition, in a paper published in Environmental Health in 2014, researchers found high exposure to low frequency traffic noise at around 125 Hz very likely to induce hypertension [^4].  Other researchers have also found significant associations between low frequency exposure to chronic diseases such as headaches, unusual tiredness, lack of concentration, irritation, and pressure on the eardrum [^5].

In short, our evolving work environment and the increasing number of environmental health research is pointing to a deficiency in this single-value system. We are in need of a metric that is much more suited to assessing a much wider spectrum of sound-material interactions that have tremendous non-auditory effects on our health such as mental health and daily well being.   

***What we propose is a 3-step approach to first establish a new sound testing protocol beyond the single-value system, and a design protocol that relies on the new testing protocol to tests for sound absorption effacacies related to surface geometry and material compositions.*** 

Our first step is to understand environmental noise to a fuller extent. We recorded and graphed environmental noise in and around our work environments. The purpose is to record and profile noises of common types of equipment and how it differs from “background” noise.  We have started collecting sound samples and other relevant data in a library of noise. This work will continue to expand.

For the second step, we have built an acoustical testing station and developed a testing protocol to conduct  tests with full spectrum sound. The first round of tests is to profile common and commercial acoustical products. We are in the process of gathering enough data so we can test out some common sound isolation theories.  

Lastly, we are using the noise profile and testing system to help us design a structural and material system that can be adapted to any noise environments whether its high pitch machine noise from desktop prototyping machinery or low frequency traffic noise. These 3-step approach help us for a productive feed-back system between design and engineering, and we expect to make headway into this in the coming months.

### Material Testing Methodology

Standard NRC and STC tests at done at 1/3rd octave band center frequencies between 100Hz to 4000Hz (human vocal range). This means noise samples are only collected at discrete frequency levels in a limited frequency range. We decided to do a full spectrum sweep between 20Hz to 20,000Hz which is the human hearing range. 

For equipment, we are using a measurement microphone that is factory calibrated to records a flat profile. We also use a studio monitor with a tweeter and 6-inch woofer so we also get as close to a flat speaker profile as possible. This system is tested in an open field to emulate an infinite baffle, and we were able to get a fairly flat frequency response until below 60Hz where it begins to drop out.  

Physically, we set up a rig with an aluminum extrusion so the distance between the speaker and the microphone are kept 1 meter apart. We designed a material clamping system so the testing material can be mounted directly on the rail and right up against the speaker to minimize reflected sound.

Finally for the setup, we have a dedicated space setup to facilitate the acoustical testing. The space is large enough for the studio monitor and microphone to be 6 feet away from surrounding surfaces, and we are using sound absorbing foam on all the wall surfaces to minimize reflected sound. 

At the beginning of each testing session, we take 4 of measurements without any materials between the speaker and the microphone and average it out as baseline. Subsequent measurements with actual material samples are then collected. Acoustical samples are continually being collected and tested, this will be an ongoing exercise until the research ends.

### Environmental Noise Measurements

#### Environmental Noise Recording Methodology

For sound recording, we are using a Zoom H1 Digital Recorder with 2 unidirectional microphones set at 90 degrees to one another recording a wide sound field, and an Extech 407730- Digital sound level meter to record the sound pressure level (SPL) of the source, typically 1 meter away or as noted. If the situation does not allow for the recording to be at 1 meter away, a 2 meter distance is used and the Inverse Square Law - reduction of 6 decibel per meter - to adjust for the final value. 



### *dL  =  20 log (R2 / R1)*  

*where:*

*dL = difference in sound pressure level (dB)*

*R1 = distance from source to location 1 (ft, m)*

*R2 = distance from source to location 2 (ft, m)*



The sound pressure level is recorded with A-weighting on the instrument, which is weighted to human sound perception. The initial recordings are recorded at about 36 locations profiling various kinds of noise, from a single point source produced by a single machine, an omnisource produced by an extraction fan that is omnipresent, to background noise produced by foot and vehicular traffic. 



We also referenced Health Link British Columbia [^5] for typical noise types and their average decibels levels, and we established that around 50 dB is what a quiet work environment would be, high 70s dB can be irritating to people, and above 85 dB would be considered harmful if there is long term exposure. 

[^5]: https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tf4173

Based on this information, we collated our recordings and profiled spaces that can serve as our baseline for what a quiet work environment would be, and spaces with frequent noise level above 75 dB.

### Data Processing Protocol

In addition to recording the sound pressure levels,  the sound is also recorded as a sound file in .WAV 24bit / 96kHz format. The .WAV file is then brought into Audacity where we use its Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to plot the spectrum. However, since Audacity’s spectral-graph is not weighted to human hearing, the data is exported out as a text file and then brought into Python to apply A-weighting with the following equation.



##### A-Weighting Equation [^6]

![alt text](images/a-weighting-eq.gif)

*where:*

*WA = weighting to be applied, dB*

*f = frequency, Hz*



[^6]: http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/a/w/aweighting/source.html



##### A-Weighting

 A-weighting function generated based the equation above. A-weighting modifies the sound file to simulate human hearing perception. Human hearing is less sensitive in the low and high frequency range. Since, our recording is using a measurement microphone that records a flat profile. We applied this weighting function to all our sound recording so the noise environment closely resembles our hearing.

### Measurement Results

From the recordings, we established that the profile from the Pratt Career Center can be used as our normal quiet work environment baseline. The peak decibel level in that space is 53 dBA, well below normal conversation level, which is around 60 dB.

And as a comparison, this noise profile is from an even quieter office but with a 3D printer running. As you can see, the sound pressure level is lower mostly below 1 kHz and the increased noise level is mostly in the region of higher frequencies above 2 kHz. But the SPL reading shows a lower level at 50.5 dBA.
