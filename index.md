## Statement

The Interdisciplinary Technology Lab is a space where intellectual networks converge and where future worlds are being prototyped. As a design and technology think tank, it is shaping the discourse through pedagogical development, case studies, and new forms of knowledge dissemination. These pillars are cumulatively charting a course for both the future of education and the way we practice. ITLâ€™s primary area of focus is built around the work of the Medium Analysis Group (MAG). It is here where we are developing a diverse network of applications in robotics, simulation, mechatronics, and collaborative computation that is laying the groundwork to take on the more difficult challenges that we are confronted with today through the design of more eloquent questions. It is this trajectory of thinking and practice that is placing the Institute at the vanguard of technological output and building an ecology of hard and soft tools that fortify creative inquiry and research while affording our community the opportunity to become change agents in their respective fields.

The Medium Analysis Group (MAG) explores how data augments and mediates design processes by creating more intelligent feedback loops between the physical and virtual worlds. This knowledge is applied to material practice, spatiotemporal constructs, and ecological psychology, with a goal to enhance the relationship between the human condition and the environments that we surround ourselves with. MAG is capitalizing on enabling technologies to create new forms of design workflows,  environmental performance systems, and production efficiency in a broad set of applications across multiple scales. The work is highlighted in diverse application areas that include, sentient collaborative robotics, engineered design fabrication tools, spatial analysis & simulation, and high-performance environmental enclosures.
